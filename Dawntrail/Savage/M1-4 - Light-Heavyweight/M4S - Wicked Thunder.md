___
### Wrath of Zeus
Hard hitting raidwide
___
### Bewitching Flight
Laser Lines from normal + Electromines that will always spawn on the West. The mines will always cleave the bottom half OR top half of every tile. These resolve at the same time.

Floor lines will appear from Normal. They will go off either In-First or Out-First.

Get close to spread positions. Boss will begin casting "Electrifying Witch Hunt," spawning more Electro Mines that always spawn on the East + 1 on the North that shoots directly toward the middle.

Identify which floor lines are going off and dodge accordingly while dodging the Electro Mine cleaves. As this goes off. all members of 1 role group (DPS or Supports) will get targeted with a Jump that hits with a point-blank AoE. Each of these players will get a Vuln debuff that makes it so they can't take the next attack, which is baitable.

One of 2 possible symbols will appear on the boss to determine where the baiters need to go:
![[Pasted image 20240819113402.png]]

In Hector's example, Supports were hit first and the first Line AoEs to go off were on the edges. She will be targeting the nearest players, so Tanks and Ranged swap so the Ranged are closest to the boss: ![[Pasted image 20240819113546.png]]
___
### Widening/Narrowing Witch Hunt
One of 2 possibilities:
Widening Witch Hunt
	Out > In > Out > In
Narrowing Witch Hunt
	In > Out > In > Out

Ins are Donut AoEs, Outs are Point-Blank AoEs.

Comes in combination with 4 sets of Near/Far baits that target 2 players each. They always alternate: Which one hits first is random.

Supports take 1st baits, DPS take 2nd. Healer/Ranged will always take Far baits, Melee/Tanks will always take Near baits.

Stand at clock positions. Adjust for 1st Widening/Narrowing; players taking first Near/Far baits move in/out as needed on their clock spots while dodging Widening Narrowing.

If you get combinations that don't mix well (ex. Near Hunts, Far Baits), players baiting use waymarkers and rest of party adjust In/Out farther than waymarks to compensate.
___
### Wrath of Zeus 2
Same as the first.
___
### Electrope Edge
Spawns Electromines in each corner.

Each player needs to stand on a cardinal.

Boss casts "Witchgleam" and sends line AoEs to each corner. You need to count and see which corners are only hit once.

Corners that are hit once will only explode their tiles. Those hit twice will explode their tile and all adjacent tiles.

Boss will cast "Symphony Fantastique" and "Sidewise Spark." Dodge to the side not being cleaved and look at how many pink orbs are floating around her.

8 smaller orbs = Spread
4 Larger orbs = Partner stack
Positions are boss relative since any of the 4 corners can be safe. Group 1 Left/Group 2 Right facing the boss.

Static spread positions:
![[Pasted image 20240819140353.png]]

Static partner positions
![[Pasted image 20240819140502.png]]
___
### Wicked Jolt
Tankbuster. Only 2 in the fight; have tanks invuln. Otherwise, double tank swap needed.
___
### Electrope Edge 2
Standard clock spots.

Grid appears on floor. Each player gets a debuff. 4 players will have a short timer, the other 4 will have long timers. 2 per role group will have each timer.

The players are going to be charged to do larger AoEs instead of static cubes in the corner. As you get hit by "Witchgleam" AoEs, count how many times you get hit.

If you have a long timer, add +1 to your total off the rip.

The boss will cast "Lightning Cage" and this exact pattern will appear:
![[Pasted image 20240819141052.png]]
Note that the gap that's in the North spot shown in the example above can be on any wall. This is the safe spot for people not dropping AoEs. However, the pattern itself never changes. For this, assume that North is the safe spot unless otherwise stated.

Long debuffs head North and park there. Everyone else is going to go to a safe spot depending on how many times they got charged by "Witchgleam." T/H go Left, DPS go Right; 2's North and 3's South. The AoEs do heavy damage.
![[Pasted image 20240819141321.png]]

Once this resolves, immediately rush center and find True North; dodge the "Sidewise Spark" and Spread/Pair Stack based on what the boss symbols state.

Spread ![[Pasted image 20240819141617.png]]
Partner stack changes because each player with a debuff needs to be with another player that doesn't have one still.

Tanks/Healers are always North/South, DPS are always Under the boss and Side of the boss.
![[Pasted image 20240819141756.png]]

After, the pattern from before will appear again. Find the Safe opening and dodge as before. In this example shown, East is the new Safe spot.
![[Pasted image 20240819141934.png]]
___
### Wicked Bolt
5 hit stack AoE. Don't need to overmitigate, but make sure everyone's topped off from previous mechanic.
___
### Ion Cluster
All players will get either a Blue or Yellow debuff, 2 per role group getting each.

Boss jumps North, pulls out her gun and cleaves one side of the arena. Boss' hitbox will shift, use to predict safe side.

3/4 of the floor disappears. Boss jumps to middle of it and casts "Electron Stream." This hits hard, mitigate heavily.

One side of the boss will glow Blue, the other Yellow. Get hit by the opposite color from your debuff. These are Wild Charges, tanks stay close. After first hit, one stack of your debuff is cleansed, but you get a new one.

![[Pasted image 20240819142431.png]]

In order:
Small point-blank AoE.
Small donut.
Hit nearest player.
Need to get hit by one of the players with an arrow debuff.
Hit farthest player.

Static spots (DN Strat). The green dots signify where you need to stand. Very tight positioning.
![[Pasted image 20240819142619.png]]
This is the priority shown, Boss relative when facing boss:
Tank with Donut/AoE goes on Left spot, DPS with same debuff goes on Right spot.
Player with the purple debuff stands directly center.
Player with arrow stands slightly inside of center.

This is followed by another Electron Stream, which reapplies the debuffs. Rinse and repeat until all debuffs are cleansed, 3 times in total.
___
### Wicked Jolt 2
Same as the first. Tank who didn't take the 1st one invulns it this time.
___
### Electrope Transplant
Clockspots, but rotate them 180 degrees since the boss will be facing South so melee can hit positionals. Once the cast finishes, we get these ground AoEs:
![[Pasted image 20240819144626.png]]
Dodge slightly clockwise from your corner, then back to your corner. Healers/Ranged out. After the 5th hit, either all Supports or all DPS are hit with an AoE. Players hit will need to be protected from the next attack by their corner partner. Players not hit will stand between the boss and the players hit. Boss will target the players hit with a line AoE. Dodge one more cleave, then the boss will repeat this mechanic.

Once done, everyone stack South and mitigate for a bunch of raidwides before the boss jumps up and the arena changes to begin Phase 2.
___
### Cross Tail Switch
HUGE raidwide damage spread across 9 hits. Tank LB as the castbar crosses the "S" in "Switch." Still mitigate and heal.

Group 1 Left, Group 2 Right. Exaflares appear in this pattern:
![[Pasted image 20240819150141.png]]
The safe lane will be the one with 2 arrows going away from you. Wicked Blaze will target the healers for stack damage. Doesn't hit hard.
Wait for stack to go off, then move into your safe lane staying stacked.
___
### Wicked Special
2 possibilities: 
![[Pasted image 20240819171849.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240819171924.png]]
Single Sword = Sides are safe.
2 Purple Orbs = Middle is safe.
___
### Mustard Bomb
Party stacks mid. 2 players get tethers. Tanks grab tethers; required heavy mit.

Once tanks have tethers, move to the exact positions shown below. Tanks need to note which 2 players do not have debuffs.
![[Pasted image 20240819172130.png]]
Tanks need to spread their debuff to one of the 2 players who was not targeted; MT takes Left-most, OT takes Right-most, then move back to their positions.
___
### Aetherial Conversion
Tentacles will glow either Red or Blue, and either the Left or Right will light up first. These will be saved and used when the boss casts "Tail Thrust."

Red = Giant AoE to that side of the arena.
![[Pasted image 20240819172411.png]]

Blue = Knockback from red dot.
![[Pasted image 20240819172510.png]]
___
### Azure Thunder
Heavy raidwide, arena changes to be circle.
___
### Twilight Sabbath
Stack tightly middle. "Wicked Fire" will drop AoEs under each player. 4 rings will spawn clones that appear 2 at a time. Each cleaves half the arena. Don't dodge until the player AoEs appear.

2nd set is accompanied by "Wicked Special."
___
### Midnight Sabbath
Spread to these positions:
![[Pasted image 20240819172733.png]]

Note the following:
Dodge TOWARD birds, dodge AWAY FROM gun.
Bird = Donut AoE
![[Pasted image 20240819172823.png]]
Gun = Line AoE
![[Pasted image 20240819172845.png]]

8 rings appear at the same time. 4 clones (either All Cardinals or Intercardinals) will appear slightly quicker. Accompanied by Scattered/Concentrated Burst.
Scattered = Spread > Pairs
Concentrated = Pairs > Spread

When the clones drop down, identify if it's a bird or a gun clone.
Bird
- Rotate CCW to dodge the Bird AoE.
- Resolve Scattered/Concentrated Burst within AoE.
- ![[Pasted image 20240819173446.png]]
Gun
-  Move to Cardinal/Intercardinal (Opposite of where Gun clones are).
- Resolve Scattered/Concentrated Burst within safe spot.
- ![[Pasted image 20240819173425.png]]
It is possible to get Double Bird or Double Gun.

This is immediately followed by another "Wicked Special" and "Wicked Thunder."
___
### Aetherial Conversion 2
Same as the first. Type in chat, won't resolve for a while
___
### Flame Slash
Dodge to sides, arrange (from North to South) T > M > H > R. Center of the arena will be destroyed.
___
### Raining Swords
Towers, soaked in order mentioned in "Flame Slash." Spawns swords that will be used in next mechanic.
___
### Chain Lightning
The boss will target 3 swords with lightning. You need to remember which order the swords were safe in. It will be different for each side; calling out in voice will only cause confusion.
![[Pasted image 20240819174055.png]]
Each side will be targeted 4 times. Once the safe order is known, dodge while hugging inside of arena.
![[Pasted image 20240819174228.png]]

Tail Thrust will resolve immediately.
___
### Mustard Bomb 2
Same as the first.
___
### Aetherial Conversion 3
Same as the first. Type in chat, won't be resolved for a while. Followed by "Azure Thunder" raidwide.
___
### Ion Cluster 2
Arena changes again, get the same debuffs from first mechanic. Note debuff and timer.
___
### Sunrise Sabbath
6 clones spawn, 4 Guns and 2 Birds. The birds tell you where some towers will appear.
![[Pasted image 20240819174731.png]]
The birds will be facing where the towers will be going. In the example above, they're looking directly across the arena. This may not be the case. The towers will be at a Cardinal.
![[Pasted image 20240819174812.png]]
Long debuffs take towers. 2 per tower. DPS look N and go CW, Supports look NW and go CCW.
![[Pasted image 20240819174922.png]]

Short debuff players need to be baited to face out. Bait a gun with the opposite color of your debuff. Tight positioning here, be close to gun and tight against wall:
![[Pasted image 20240819175017.png]]

Dodge "Wicked Special."

The mechanic repeats. Long debuffs now bait guns, short debuff players soak towers.

Final "Tail Thrust" resolves.

Uptime AutoCad Sunrise:
Need specific waymarkers. Stand on edge closest of waymark closest to tower.
![[Pasted image 20240819175249.png]]
___
### Sword Quiver
Soft enrage. Get with Partners (T/M North, H/R South).
![[Pasted image 20240819175404.png]]

These 3 lines never change; only the horizontal line changes.
![[Pasted image 20240819175455.png]]
 Safe spots can look like the following:
 ![[Pasted image 20240819175514.png]]
 ![[Pasted image 20240819175528.png]]
 ![[Pasted image 20240819175547.png]]

___
### Wicked Thunder
Enrage.
