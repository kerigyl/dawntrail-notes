### Bewitching Flight
Laser Lines from normal + Electromines that will always spawn on the West. The mines will always cleave the bottom half OR top half of every tile. These resolve at the same time.

Floor lines will appear from Normal. They will go off either In-First or Out-First.

Get close to spread positions. Boss will begin casting "Electrifying Witch Hunt," spawning more Electro Mines that always spawn on the East + 1 on the North that shoots directly toward the middle.

Identify which floor lines are going off and dodge accordingly while dodging the Electro Mine cleaves. As this goes off. all members of 1 role group (DPS or Supports) will get targeted with a Jump that hits with a point-blank AoE. Each of these players will get a Vuln debuff that makes it so they can't take the next attack, which is baitable.

One of 2 possible symbols will appear on the boss to determine where the baiters need to go:

In Hectors example, Supports were hit first and the first Line AoEs to go off were on the edges. She will be targeting the nearest players, so Tanks and Ranged swap so the Ranged are closest to the boss: ![[Pasted image 20240819113546.png]]
