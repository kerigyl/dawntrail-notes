___
### Wrath of Zeus
Hard hitting raidwide
___
### Bewitching Flight
Laser Lines from normal + Electromines that will always spawn on the West. The mines will always cleave the bottom half OR top half of every tile. These resolve at the same time.

Floor lines will appear from Normal. They will go off either In-First or Out-First.

Get close to spread positions. Boss will begin casting "Electrifying Witch Hunt," spawning more Electro Mines that always spawn on the East + 1 on the North that shoots directly toward the middle.

Identify which floor lines are going off and dodge accordingly while dodging the Electro Mine cleaves. As this goes off. all members of 1 role group (DPS or Supports) will get targeted with a Jump that hits with a point-blank AoE. Each of these players will get a Vuln debuff that makes it so they can't take the next attack, which is baitable.

One of 2 possible symbols will appear on the boss to determine where the baiters need to go:

In Hector's example, Supports were hit first and the first Line AoEs to go off were on the edges. She will be targeting the nearest players, so Tanks and Ranged swap so the Ranged are closest to the boss: ![[Pasted image 20240819113546.png]]
___
### Widening/Narrowing Witch Hunt
One of 2 possibilities:
Widening Witch Hunt
	Out > In > Out > In
Narrowing Witch Hunt
	In > Out > In > Out

Ins are Donut AoEs, Outs are Point-Blank AoEs.

Comes in combination with 4 sets of Near/Far baits that target 2 players each. They always alternate: Which one hits first is random.

Supports take 1st baits, DPS take 2nd. Healer/Ranged will always take Far baits, Melee/Tanks will always take Near baits.

Stand at clock positions. Adjust for 1st Widening/Narrowing; players taking first Near/Far baits move in/out as needed on their clock spots while dodging Widening Narrowing.

If you get combinations that don't mix well (ex. Near Hunts, Far Baits), players baiting use waymarkers and rest of party adjust In/Out farther than waymarks to compensate.
___
### Wrath of Zeus 2
Same as the first.
___
### Electrope Edge
Spawns Electromines in each corner.

Each player needs to stand on a cardinal.

Boss casts "Witchgleam" and sends line AoEs to each corner. You need to count and see which corners are only hit once.

Corners that are hit once will only explode their tiles. Those hit twice will explode their tile and all adjacent tiles.
