[[Savage]] [[Arcadion 1]]

[Guide Used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UB5x8JzAiQ)
### Pre-Pull Setup
- Clocks (True North or Boss Relative) - True North used in Hector Guide
- Partners (T/H rotate CW)
- Light Parties
___
### Quadruple Crossing
Targets closest players with cleave. Does it twice; need DPS and Support to swap due to vuln stack.

DPS stand close to boss on intercardinals. Have Supports swap spots with their partners.

Follows up with third and fourth cleaves where the players were standing relative to the boss. Having everyone stand on intercardinals negates having to time movement. See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOCqbHRQw2Q) for breakdown; useful for later variation.

___
### Biscuit Maker
2 hit Tankbuster. Tank Swap or Invuln.
___
### Nine Lives
Buff that stores the upcoming mechanic.
___
### 2 x One-Two Paw
Same as normal. Memory check; the boss will do it again soon and will cleave the same side of the room that it did the first time.
___
### Soulshade
Boss spawns 2 clones, one at a random intercardinal and one at a random cardinal. They will take the One-Two Paw and cast it at the same time later.

Note the safe side and make sure you are standing in the safe spot when this resolves. Move diagonally across the boss to dodge the 2nd hit.

The boss will case Nine Lives to store the next mechanic, one of 2 variations that goes off immediately after cleaves.
___
### Double/Quadruple Swipe
Double = Party Stacks
Quadruple = Partners

This will be saved and put into the next clone.
___
### Leaping Quadruple Crossing
Same as the first, but done relative to where the boss will be jumping. Move to resolve the clone as the 2nd AoE goes off.

NW/SE for LP meets.
___
### Bloody Scratch
Raidwide; hits hard.
___
### Mouser
Basically Devour. 2 possible movements, look at Waymark 3 in the Hector guide (SE internal square):
- If 3 is hit **once**, move 4 > 3.
- If 3 is hit twice, move 4 > 3 > 2
___
### Copycat
Center broken tiles come back like new and spawns a clone.

Boss will target all DPS or all Supports one at a time. One of 2 animations.

- If the clone is Kneeling, you want to stand on a cracked tile. This will cast Uppercut and knock you away. If you get this and have trouble seeing where the clone is, stand in a corner and face the opposite corner.
	 - Unlike on Normal, you want to face in the direction you're getting hit to and point toward a clean tile. When you land, AoEs will radiate out from the tile you started on. In this example, the player started in the very NW tile:
	 ![[Pasted image 20240731171554.png]]
- If the clone is Standing, you want to stand on a fresh tile.

Followed by Biscuit Maker and Shockwave (Knockback, cannot be immuned).

Light Party stacks. 2 corners of the arena will be repaired faster than the other corners. LPs want to get knocked back into the first corners to appear. Huge knockback, be directly under boss.

Followed by spread markers. Melee/Tanks in, Healers and Ranged out.
___
### Nine Lives > Leaping One-Two Paw
Resolve as before. Both the Leap and the One-Two Paw will be saved and put in a clone. Say "Inside/Outside Safe First" instead of Right/Left.
___
### Soulshade 2
Spawns a clone. The clone will have both the Leap and the One-Two Paw saved. The boss will have a debuff with an arrow for the One-Two paw. The arrow is relative to which direction the clone is facing.

Followed by another Nine Lives and Leaping Quadruple Crossing. Resolve as before; no spice.

Both the Leap and Quadruple Crossing will be put into the next clone with the next Soulshade cast. Pull boss to intersection.
![[Pasted image 20240731172653.png]]

First clone will jump one tile over first. LP splits North or South to handle Tempestuous Tear (Line AoE stacks). After, position boss like this:

![[Pasted image 20240731172813.png]]
Get into clock positions around the boss, but wait for Nailchipper to cast first (Targeted AoEs). Nailchipper targets all DPS or all Supports. Whichever gets targeted first cannot take first cleaves from clone.

Dodge clone cleaves. Make sure you're with your partners at the end (Nailchipper players should be out, but no biggie if you stack).
___
### Bloody Scratch
Raidwide; Mitigate.
___
### Mouser 2
If 3 is hit once: 4 > 3
If 3 is hit twice: 4 > 3 > 2

Copycat clone spawns. Same as the first, but other group gets targeted this time with one of 2 additional mechanics going off as well:

Overshadow - Line Stack marker, needs the entire group minus the 1 player.
Splintering Nails - Conal AoE that targets 1 tank, 1 healer and 1 DPS. Role stacks, T > H > D

Followed by Biscuit Maker and Shockwave.
___
### Raining Cats
Tethers. Specific positioning required:
![[Pasted image 20240731173643.png]]

The Nearest and Farthest players need to be players without tethers because they get targeted with shared damage AoEs.

After Tanks, Healers swap out and Tanks move in with the party. Follow with Melee then Ranged.

You can also have the tanks invuln by doing the following:
- Non-tank role takes first tether.
- Tanks take tethers and 2nd hits.
- Both invuln, one goes in and the other goes out. Party stacks on edge of bosses hitbox south.
- ![[Pasted image 20240731173940.png]]
___
### Predacious Pounce
Combined with One-Two Paw. Stay close to N/S line in center to dodge One-Two Paw and ensure you don't get hit by an AoE.
___
### Mouser
Enrage. All tiles will be hit; kill before they all disappear.
