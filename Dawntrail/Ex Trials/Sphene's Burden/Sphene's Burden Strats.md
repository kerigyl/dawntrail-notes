Group 1 Left, Group 2 Right. Dodge Legitimate Force cast and move into your appropriate tower.

2 more towers appear on each platform. One player on each platform gets a tether, one gets a large AOE.

These 4 players will need to begin floating. Tether players go to their closest North corner. AOE player go directly E/W. Remaining 4 players soak towers. Plenty of time to resolve, don't need static towers.

Every player returns to the ground and is targeted with meteors. Each platform needs 4 on it, each player will get hit twice.

Drop 1st ones on platform; begin floating and drop next 4 in center between platforms.
	![[Pasted image 20241124174529.png]]

Return to platform, become grounded and stand behind back meteors.

Red individual stack markers appear. Center players can stay stacked; players on each side should meet up to resolve.

**N/S Prio**
	Stack like this.
	![[Pasted image 20241124180046.png]]
	Watch which role gets tethered. The Northernmost player between each role (T/H/M/R) will take the N bridge; the Southernmost player will take the S on their side of the platform.

**Fixed Bridge/"Braindead"**
If tethered Right, go Right. If Tethered Left, go left.

South Tethers move first: Outer Tether take North bridge, Inner Tether take South bridge.
![[Pasted image 20241124180330.png]]
