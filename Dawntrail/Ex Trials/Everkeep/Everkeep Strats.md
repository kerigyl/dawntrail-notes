![[Pasted image 20240703183915.png]]
___
### Actualize
- Raidwide, used frequently; mitigate when able.
___
### Multidirectional Divide
- Cross AoE, Leaves lines behind and fires line AoEs. Can walk on lines before they resolve.
- At the same time, the boss will cast Forward/Backward Half, which will leave a small safe spot.
	- Backward = Safe Behind Him
	- Forward = Safe In Front Of Him
	 He will also cleave half the room on one of his sides. Look for the glowing sword.
		 If Forward, you will want to be on the side WITH the glowing sword. When his character jumps forward he will do a 180 and cleave the other side.
Once this resolves, he will do another Multidirectional Divide. Stack behind the boss.
___
### Regicidal Rage
2 x Tank Buster Tethers, AoE Buster + Vuln
- LP1 Tank go W, LP2 Tank go E
This goes off at the same time as the last Multidirectional Divide.
___
### Dawn Of An Age 1

![[Pasted image 20240708055318.png]]
___
### Greater Gateway
Tethers outer platforms to Main Platform like in Normal

2 platforms are connected with Purple Tethers, other 2 are connected with Wind and Fire tethers.

**Blade Warp**
- Summons swords that do line AoEs like in Normal.

Pay attention to beginning and end points of each tether. Purple tethers do what you expect. Fire and Wind are changed entirely.

**Fire Tether**
- Expands AoE to cover 3 rows. Leaves farthest tether from that end tether to be safe.

**Wind Tether**
- Knockback From Target Row by 1. Row inside spot next to it is safe. Can KB Immune

Every player will get a pyramid marker over their head. Causes the tile under them to pulse. Everyone needs to be in a different ground square. Use eyes.

Followed by Actualize. Arena returns to normal.
___
### Projection Of Triumph
Summons 16 swords on the arena.
2 beams move & explode when touching swords, Donut Beam + Point Blank AoE Beam.
![[Pasted image 20240703190421.png]]
Green beams move across and cause the swords to go off.

You can stand between 2 PB spots and be safe, then move onto a sword for the donut.
![[Pasted image 20240703190520.png]]
Tank should try to make it so melee can still hit positionals.

As the last 2 go off, watch for Forward/Backward half + Sword Cleave and adjust accordingly. Then keep dodging beams.

Followed by Actualize.
___
### Projection Of Turmoil
Debuff on every living player. Beam passes over party. Debuff causes Stack AoE when the beam touches player. Puts a small Vuln Up debuff on everyone after each hit (~2 seconds).

**Probably Intended Strat**
- Split into light parties. Some order of roles (arbitrary, use whatever PF standard is).
- Have one person stand in front of beam but close enough for stack to go off.
- As the stack goes off, everyone backs up until vuln stack falls off; next player touches beam.
- Rinse and repeat.

**"Braindead" Strat**
![[Pasted image 20240704104458.png]]
Tanks take their stacks solo (kitchen sink, no invuln), everyone else lines up (from corner with line: M > M > H > H > R > R)

~~**CHEESE STRAT** (Dead)
![[Pasted image 20240703191201.png]]
Wall does not kill. Everyone walks to the far corner from where the beam started, eats the damage and deals with the tankbuster and wait out timer. Beam will never reach party.~~

Tankbuster is a 3 hit that hits hard. If doing 2nd strat, easiest to have MT invuln, other tank will invuln it later in the fight.
___
### Dawn Of An Age 2
Raidwide + 1 other platform

Split into pairs for Enumeration
> From Left to Right when facing new platform:
> HR1 > MT 1 > MT 2 > HR 2

On hit, the marked player will be fine. The unmarked player will be thrown out into the abyss. They will need to aim at the new platform.

Boss will then move between the 2 platforms and begin the next mechanic.
___
### Vollok & Sync 2
Summons a giant sword on each platform. They will cover that quadrant with an AoE.

When Sync goes off, the quadrant from each platform will sync with the opposite platform. See image for clarification.
![[Pasted image 20240703192345.png]]
Players will also have the same Pyramid markers from before. Same thing: Use Eyes. Stand on close quadrant: MT on closer 2, HR on farther 2.

Aero III drops Tornado that will toss players relative to the angle which they enter it and get Wind Resistance Down. Boss will case Forward/Backward Half. The unsafe side needs to move to safe platform. Room cleave will hit the row closest to boss.
___
### Duty's Edge
4 x Split Damage, Damage goes up each hit.

Stay stacked until chains appear. Random Support will be tethered to Random DPS.

Whoever didn't get thrown the first time will need to get thrown this time and spread to break chains.

Move close to boss for healing and Mit; Actualize + Platform returns to normal.
___
### Projection Of Triumph 2
Same As The First, except the boss will cast Half Circuit.

Half Circuit - Summons 2 swords around boss.

**Swords Inside Hitbox***
-Point-Blank AoE + Half Room Cleave

**Swords Outside Hitbox**
Donut AOE around him instead of half-room cleave. Watch sword for safe half, move into bosses hitbox while dodging beam mechanics.

While Half Circuit resolves, Regicidal Rage tank tethers will appear. Tanks get tethers and dodge mechanics.
___
### Projection Of Turmoil 2
