___
### Specter of the Lost
Tankbuster tether, spawns on 2 random players. Stay away from party.
___
### Escelons' Fall
Start in these positions:
	![[Pasted image 20250328185306.png]]

![[Pasted image 20250328182534.png]]
___
### Stock Break
Multihit stack, hits 4 times. Mitigate.
___
### Blessed Barricade
Supports go W, DPS go E.

4 Roseblood Drops show up, need to be DPS'd down.

1 Support and 1 DPS will be tethered to adds on their respective sides, with a 3 person tower on each side.

Tether players need to rotate the add so the point of the sword is facing out of the arena, because the add will cleave that side. They will be in the telegraph of the attack, so they need to dodge out quickly.

This sequence repeats 3 times, with all 4 players getting tethered. DPS down the drops.

If the bosses bar does not fill up, she will cast "Perfumed Quietus," a raidwide. Mitigate.
___
### Roseblood Bloom
Arena changes. 
![[Pasted image 20250328185824.png]]

Note that some of the tiles are red, and some are plain. Some attacks will make the red tiles unsafe. The very center is unsafe and will apply a spicy DoT.

Alexandrian Thunder II
	 Boss will start 3 rotating conal cleaves. Start behind the rotation of the attack and slowly follow it as it rotates, staying off the red tiles. There are a couple variations, but the rule is the same.

All players will get a targeted AOE on them, red tiles are no longer unsafe, however they will become unsafe when the AOEs go off. Free-For-All spread, stay off the red tiles.
___
### Thorned Catharsis 2
Arena returns to normal. Raidwide, mitigate.
___
### Roseblood: 2nd Bloom
Stage transitions again, stay out of middle. Similar to first, but fewer safe tiles.
![[Pasted image 20250328190335.png]]

The boss will cast Thunder Slash, 2 conal AOEs that go off in the order they appear, with a telegraphed In/Out. If the flowers are inside the center circle, first safe spot is outside; and vice versa.

If Out is safe first, go to the side with 2 **inner** safe tiles.
If In is safe first, go to the side with 2 **outer** safe tiles.

Dodge the In/Out, then check if you need to immediately dodge to the side or not. Red tiles are no longer unsafe after In/Out.
___
### Specter of the Lost 2
Tankbuster tethers.
___
### Roseblood: 3rd Bloom
This mechanic will always appear with this pattern, though it may be rotated:
![[Pasted image 20250328190738.png]]

Find the safe tile in the middle of the 2 inner red tiles. This is New North, so you want to look at it like this:
![[Pasted image 20250328190819.png]]

All players will go to their Color Pair Relative spots.

Boss will case "Bud of Valor," and the 4 outside red tiles will have tower spires in them. The entire tile is now a tower.

"Emblazon" targets all 4 Supports or DPS's with Rosebud Drops. When the attack goes off, the tile they are standing in will become red tiles.

To begin: Non-Emblazoned players need to stand in these exact spots in the outer tile:
![[Pasted image 20250328191033.png]]

When the Rosebuds go off, all connected tiles will count as one large connected tower. If you accidentally drop them in a way that the tower tiles are connected, you cannot resolve the mechanic. Rosebuds need to be dropped like this:
![[Pasted image 20250328191209.png]]
Players that dropped AOEs now need to walk off the red tiles, and the other players need to make sure there is one per tower:
![[Pasted image 20250328191308.png]]
___
### Thorned Catharsis 3
Raidwide. Mitigate.
___

### Escelon's Fall 2
Boss will cast "Bud of Valor."
Supports W, DPS E.

3 random players (all from one role group) will get Donut shock AOEs from earlier.
1 Support and 1 DPS each will get a stack marker.
![[Pasted image 20250328191912.png]]
Use Fan Spreads.

Note the pattern that flashes as before. Same rules apply.

The donut AOEs go off before the mechanic can finish, which locks the donut role in place. The other role needs to take the first Spreads, either Near or Far.

Follow the rules as before, and swap properly.
___
### Stock Break
Stack Marker.
___
### Roseblood: 4th Bloom
![[Pasted image 20250328191956.png]]

When boss casts "Emblazon," 2 ground AOEs appear.

4 players will get Rosebuds on them. They go opposite the ground AOEs.

Other 4 players go near ground AOEs and spread in anticipation of the spread markers on them.

Spread **EXACTLY LIKE THIS**:
![[Pasted image 20250328192204.png]]

If the 2 edge players are touching the 2 South tiles, the entire South part of the arena becomes 1 giant red tile and the AOEs will kill those 4 players.
![[Pasted image 20250328192247.png]]

All players meet up in 1 of the safe tiles and stack tightly together for "Encircling Thorns."
![[Pasted image 20250328192337.png]]

When the purple circles disappear, Supports will be tethered to a DPS. Boss casts "Alexandrian Banish III" which puts a stack marker on one of the healers.

All Supports run W, all DPS run E. The Stack Marker is an 8 person stack marker, so all the DPS will need to move into a red tile, and the Supports need to stay off the red tile but make sure it hits the adjacent tile to them without being on it.
![[Pasted image 20250328192537.png]]
___
### Thorned Catharsis 4
Raidwide.
___
### Escelon's Fall 3
"Bud of Valor" symbols again. Same rules apply.

Watch adds on edge, one of them will telegraph a half-room cleave. Dodge, then move back into position and resolve like the 1st.

Around the 3rd cleave, look at the other add; they will telegraph another half-room cleave. Finish the Escelon's Fall dodge, then move to avoid cleave.
___
### Stock Break
Stack.
___
### Roseblood: 5th Bloom
Boss casts "Valorous Ascension" twice. Raidwide damage.

Look for 2 "swipe" attacks:
![[Pasted image 20250328192856.png]]

2 sets of 2 will appear. Whichever one appears 1st, go to the opposite side. In the below screenshot, the North set appeared first:
![[Pasted image 20250328192947.png]]

Boss casts "Thunder Slash" In/Out. Note if In or Out is safe first.

Position yourselves in the correct quadrant, and either In or Out. After everything goes off, rotate 3 tiles Clockwise and move In/Out depending on which was first.
___
### Specter of the Lost 3
Tankbuster
___
### Roseblood: 6th Bloom
One of 2 patterns:
![[Pasted image 20250328193227.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250328193236.png]]
"Emblazon" places towers in the red tiles, and one role group get rose drops.

As before, players without rose drops will take towers. G1 W, G2 E. Other players go to color quadrant.

Wait for "Holy Hazard," which will show 2 cleaves. The 2nd cleave goes off at the same time as the towers.

Tank LB the 2nd cleave and everyone can take the inner cleave right to the face.
___
### Roseblood: 7th Bloom
Literally a repeat of the 1st Roseblood Bloom
___
### Thorned Catharsis
Raidwide.
___
### Specter of the Lost
Tankbuster tethers.
___
### Stock Break x3

___
### Roseblood Withering
![[Pasted image 20250328194240.png]]
